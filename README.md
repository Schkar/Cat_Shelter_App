# Cat_Shelter_App
Cat Shelter App Workshop from Coder's Lab Course

Simple filtering app created with React.JS

There is also mobile version.

<strong> Warning </strong>
<p>This app is repulsive. It is intended to be so. </p>

Try to focus on "technical" aspects like usage of React, CSS (SASS) and some other JavaScript-ish parts of this project.

Thank you.
